# I'm A Tourist App

A JQuery Mobile & Phonegap application for loging visits to places, storing a photo, location and notes. It also provides the ability view these visits on a map. This Application was developed as part of my SEM2220 Mobile Web Assignment in my Final Year at University.

## ToDo List

* (Maybe) Add more detail page for each item in visit list.
* Move Away from Googles Static Map API.
* Update CSS or move to framwork to improve UI look and feel.
